SLIGHT VARIATION ON THE PTOLEMY STOP ACTOR, FOR PASSERELLE: STOPS MODEL
 EXECUTION ON RECEIVING ANY KIND OF MESSAGE, NOT JUST TRUE TOKENS... An actor
 that stops execution of a model when it receives a true token on any input
 channel. This is accomplished by calling finish() on the manager, which
 requests that the current iteration be completed and then the model execution
 be halted. If the input is not connected to anything, then this actor
 requests a stop whenever it fires.
 <p>
 When exactly this stops the execution depends on the domain. For example, in
 DE, if an event with time stamp <i>T</i> and value <i>true</i> arrives at
 this actor, then the current iteration will be concluded, and then the model
 will halt. Concluding the current iteration means processing all events in
 the event queue with time stamp <i>T</i>. Thus, it is possible for actors to
 be invoked after this one is invoked with a <i>true</i> input.
 <p>
 In SDF, if this actor receives <i>true</i>, then the current iteration is
 concluded and then execution is stopped. Similarly in SR.
 <p>
 In PN, where each actor has its own thread, there is no well-defined notion
 of an iteration. The finish() method of the manager calls stopFire() on all
 actors, which for threaded actors results in halting them upon their next
 attempt to read an input or write an output. When all actor threads have
 stopped, the iteration concludes and the model halts. <b>NOTE</b>: <i>This is
 not the best way to stop a PN model!</i> This mechanism is nondeterministic
 in the sense that there is no way to control exactly what data is produced or
 consumed on the connections before the model stops. To stop a PN model, it is
 better to design the model so that all actors are starved of data when the
 model is to stop. The director will detect this starvation, and halt the
 model. Nonetheless, if the nondeterminism is acceptable, this actor can be
 used.
