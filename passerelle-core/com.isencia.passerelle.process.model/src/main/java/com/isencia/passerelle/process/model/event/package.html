  Although this is mainly an API bundle, this package still contains some
  implementation classes.
  
  These event implementations are explicitly meant to be "transient" objects.
  So there is no issue of implementations as JPA entities versus simple POJOs etc.
  
  This is why we can risk having implementations here, we hope...
