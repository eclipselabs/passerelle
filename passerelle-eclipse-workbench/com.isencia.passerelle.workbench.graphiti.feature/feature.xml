&quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
exercising permissions granted by this License.
&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation
source, and configuration files.
&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
and conversions to other media types.
&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by
a
copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which
the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that
remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces
of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf
of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited
to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
systems,

designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions
of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of
the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
the Derivative Works; and
(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with
the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use
the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law
or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
